NB! Remember to write your tests first and make them fail before you implement the features.

1. Add more information on the Movie entity
	- The movie should have things like: year, rating, synopsis and so on. 

2. The movies returned from the server are missing some of the details to save bandwidth. Get this additional info.

	- store this information in business.Movie wrapper and expose the relevant info as getter-methods
